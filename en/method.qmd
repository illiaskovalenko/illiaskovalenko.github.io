# A structured transition toward instructional design

My approach builds on research-developed competencies:

- Deep analytical work  
- Complex system modeling  
- Logical structuring  
- Methodological rigor  

I apply these principles to learning design through:

## 1. Clarifying competencies before content

## 2. Ensuring alignment between objectives, activities and assessment

## 3. Viewing learning as an evolving system
