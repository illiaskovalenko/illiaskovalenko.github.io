# Working Framework

My methodology follows a structured progression:

## 1. Diagnosis
- Stakeholder interviews  
- Competency mapping  
- Organizational constraints analysis  

## 2. Design
- Learning objectives formulation  
- Alignment between activities and assessment  
- Selection of appropriate formats and tools  

## 3. Implementation
- Agile planning when relevant  
- LMS configuration  
- Content structuring  

## 4. Evaluation
- Competency assessment  
- Feedback integration  
- Iterative refinement  

Learning is not content delivery. It is system design.
