## Positioning

Joint PhD candidate (EPHE-PSL / UCLouvain), I leverage an analytical research background to design coherent, structured, and operational learning systems.

I am transitioning toward instructional design and digital learning with a clear objective:  
to apply systemic analytical methods to the design and management of more effective and robust training solutions.
