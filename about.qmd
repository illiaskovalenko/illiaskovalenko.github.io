## Overview

This website is a bilingual professional portfolio built with **Quarto** and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.  

Its objective -- beyond being my professional portfolio -- is to provide a structurally robust, symmetric FR/EN architecture with deterministic rendering and a dynamic language switch mechanism.

---

## Multilingual architecture

The multilingual setup was inspired by the three-profile logic described in:

<https://ati-ozgur.github.io/blog-posts/quarto-multi-language-book.html>

The idea of using distinct rendering profiles informed the architecture, but the implementation here adopts a stricter folder-level separation.

Three rendering profiles are used in this project:

- `def`: renders the root-level pages (`index.qmd` as the language selection landing page, and `about.qmd` describing how the site is built).
- `en`: renders the English version of the site.
- `fr`: renders the French version of the site.

In practice, `def` is used for the shared entry points, while `en` and `fr` handle the language-specific website configuration (navigation, paths, and page rendering).

### Source structure

```text
.
├── _quarto.yml
├── _quarto-def.yml
├── _quarto-fr.yml
├── _quarto-en.yml
├── build.ps1
├── js/
│   └── lang-switch.js
├── fr/
│   ├── index.qmd
│   ├── method.qmd
│   └── ...
└── en/
    ├── index.qmd
    ├── method.qmd
    └── ...

```

Each language has:

- its own source directory
- symmetric filenames (`/en/method.qmd` corresponds to `/fr/method.qmd)
- language-specific navigation configuration (see below)

### Main `_quarto.yml` elements

Rendering is controlled via `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

And infra:

```yml
profile:
  group:
    - [def, en, fr]
```

This configuration choses the one and only directory for the output, indicates multiple profiles, prevents recursive nesting (e.g., `docs/en/en`) and ensures predictable builds.

During development, an important behavior of Quarto had to be addressed. When rendering source `.qmd` files located inside language-specific folders (e.g., `fr/` and `en/`), Quarto preserves the source directory structure in the output directory.

This means that if the source file is:

```text
en/method.qmd
```

Quarto will generate:

```text
docs/en/method.html
```

This is expected behavior. However, when rendering was triggered from within a subdirectory or when language prefixes were redundantly declared in configuration, Quarto repeated the parent directory in the output path. As a result, nested structures such as:

```text
docs/en/en/method.html
docs/fr/fr/index.html
```

were created. In other words, Quarto replicated the mother directory structure twice during rendering.

### Rendering three language profiles

The issue was resolved by:

- enforcing a single project root
- declaring a unique `output-dir: docs`
- avoiding redundant language prefixes in configuration
- ensuring rendering is always triggered from the project root for three profiles together, with `--no-clean` option:

```powershell
quarto render --profile def --no-clean
quarto render --profile fr --no-clean
quarto render --profile en --no-clean
```

This guarantees deterministic output with no files or folders being suppressed during rendering:

```text
docs/
├── fr/
└── en/
└── index.html
└── ...
```

---

### Language switch mechanism

The site includes a custom JavaScript file:

```java
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    const path = window.location.pathname;
  
    // Supporte éventuellement un site servi sous /docs/
    const base = path.startsWith("/docs/") ? "/docs" : "";
  
    const inEN = path.startsWith(base + "/en/");
    const inFR = path.startsWith(base + "/fr/");
  
    if (!inEN && !inFR) return;
  
    // URL miroir = même chemin après /en/ ou /fr/
    const mirrorPath = inEN
      ? path.replace(new RegExp("^" + base + "/en/"), base + "/fr/")
      : path.replace(new RegExp("^" + base + "/fr/"), base + "/en/");
  
    const mirrorUrl = mirrorPath + window.location.search + window.location.hash;
  
    // On vise le bouton langue unique par son texte visible
    const navAnchors = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("nav a"));
    const target = navAnchors.find(a => {
      const t = a.textContent.trim().toLowerCase();
      return t === "english" || t === "français";
    });
  
    if (target) target.setAttribute("href", mirrorUrl);
  });  
```

The `/js` folder should be included in `resources` in the main `_quarto.yml` file:

```yml
project:
  resources:
    - js
```

 and the `html` options should include the following `include-in-header` section:

```yml
format:
  html:
    include-in-header:
      - text: |
          <script defer src="/js/lang-switch.js"></script>
```

The logic of the Java instructions mirror the current path.

Example:

- If the user is on `/en/method.html`
- Clicking the language button redirects to `/fr/method.html`

The switch does not return to the homepage but preserves the exact page path.

Only one button is displayed:

- If current language = EN → button shows `FR`
- If current language = FR → button shows `EN`

This ensures clean navigation and avoids redundant interface elements.

### Profiles' configurations

Here is the way the `_quarto-en.yml` and `_quarto-fr.yml` have been configured:

```yml
project:
  render:
    - en/*.qmd

website:
  navbar:
    background: primary
    search: true
    left:
      - href: /en/index.html
        text: Home
      - href: /en/projects.html
        text: Projects
      - href: /en/method.html
        text: Approach
      - href: /en/cv.html
        text: CV
      - href: /en/contact.html
        text: Contact
    right:
      - text: Français
        href: /fr/

format:
  html:
    lang: en-GB
    output-dir: en
```

The default profile has simpler structure, because it doesn't need the navigation bar:

```yml
project:
  render:
    - index.qmd
    - about.qmd

website:
  favicon: images/favicon.ico
  navbar: false
  search: false
```

## Build workflow

```powershell
# Go to project root (in case script is run from elsewhere)
Set-Location $PSScriptRoot

Write-Host "Rendering Quarto..."
quarto render --profile def --no-clean
quarto render --profile fr --no-clean
quarto render --profile en --no-clean

Write-Host "Git add..."
git add .

Write-Host "Git commit..."
git commit -m "Update site"

Write-Host "Git push..."
git push

Write-Host "Done."
```

A PowerShell script (`build.ps1`) is used to automate the rendering process before deployment and to push the new version of the website on to Github.

When the script is in the project root folder, you can run the entire script:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

## Development process

The site was built iteratively through:

- experimentation with multilingual profile configurations  
- debugging output directory duplication  
- refining navbar symmetry  
- writing and correcting the JavaScript path-mirroring logic  
- stabilizing CSS and font overrides  
- restructuring folders to guarantee deterministic builds  

The final structure reflects:

- precise folder hierarchy  
- explicit resource management  
- separation between content, configuration, and deployment logic

## Main contribution

This project demonstrates the construction of:

> A structured bilingual Quarto portfolio  
> with deterministic rendering and a custom dynamic language switch mechanism.

The architecture is scalable and can support additional languages without redesigning the core structure.

---

## Authorship

Parts of the configuration logic, multilingual architecture refinement, and the language-switch JavaScript were developed through iterative collaboration with ChatGPT 5.2 (OpenAI).

The final folder structure, rendering workflow, and deployment pipeline were designed, tested, and stabilized independently.
